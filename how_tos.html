<h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>This is my attempt to record what I've
learned about various technical platforms that are necessary and/or
useful for being a professional mathematician. &nbsp;I learned most of
these things by word-of-mouth and copious internet searching, so my
goal is to put information here that "everyone knows," but no one knows
where they learned it. &nbsp;I plan to start with LaTeX and HTML
guides, but I may write something about computer algebra systems
eventually (i.e. once I've learned more about them).<br><br>Warning: I
am not an expert in the inner workings of any of these things!
&nbsp;However, I think that this provides these guides with a different
(and hopefully, more useful) flavor than other guides you might find
online. &nbsp;These guides are written by a non-expert who got these
things working and these guides are intended for non-experts who just
want to get things working and don't really want to put the time into
learning all the inner workings of these technical systems.
&nbsp;Because of my non-expertise, however, I will almost certainly not
be able to help you troubleshoot.<h2> LaTeX Guides</h2>Coming soon:<br><br>How (and why) to get a local installation of LaTeX running on your computer<br>How (and when) to write your own .sty and .cls files<br>How to use BibTeX<br><br><h2>HTML Guides</h2><a href="how_tos/website_building.html">How to set up a personal website on the University of Oregon server</a> (by Katie Gedeon)<br><br><h2>Other Guides</h2>Coming soon:<br><br>How to write your own WeBWorK problems
