<p> <font color="#740A09">Q: What specifically about the clarity of instructions helped your learning?</font>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Instructions on grading are clear and there is a lot of fairness when grading materials.
        </li>
        <li>
            Halley is great. She communicates exactly what she expects you to know and is fair in her grading.
            She is very clear in her teaching and it makes sense most of the time.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p> <font color="#740A09">Q: What specifically about the instructor communication helped your learning?</font>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Professor Fritze was able to breakdown hard topics and communicate them effectively with excellent hands-on examples.
            Whenever someone had a question, she took the time to address it in depth.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p> <font color="#740A09">Q: Please say more about how non of the teaching elements above need imporvement to help your learning.</font> 
    <ul>
        <li>
            This was a very well structured class. 
            Whenever a test or quiz came about, it was always clear as to what the material would cover,
            as the material was explained in class very thoroughly.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4 style="margin-bottom: -5px;"> Calculus I Fall 2022</h4>
<hr color="#740A09">
<p> <font color="#740A09">Q: What specifically about the inclusiveness of the course helped your learning?</font>
    <ul>
        <li>
            She always allowed for student iteracions between everyone to seek help from peers as well as herself.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p> <font color="#740A09">Q: What specifically about the support from the instructor helped your learning?</font>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The in class notes were easy to understand and iterpret.
        </li>
        <li>
            Office hours were extremely helpful. She was patient and broke down problems in a very useful and helpful way.
        </li>
        <li>
            I really appreciate Halley's willingness to slowly walk through, step by step, problems that I'm having a hard time grasping.
            It's usually when I learn the most in math and I appreciate so much when math professors take the time to walk through concepts like this.
            She also gives me small rules that I've forgotten from past math courses (I've had a lot of gap times between math courses) and it continuously helps me understand so much more about math and improves my arithmetic substantially.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p> <font color="#740A09">Q: What specifically about the instructor communication helped your learning?</font>
    <ul>
        <li>
            She teaches in a way that is easy to follow and is willing to stop to answer any questions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lectures were clear and instructor responded well to questions.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p> <font color="#740A09">Q: What specifically about the organization of this course helped your learning?</font>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The way Halley teaches fits my learning style.
             Having every aspect of a problem's explanation written on the board allowed me to look back at my notes and figure out the whole process for solving more complex issues instead of being confused about how we got from one step to another.
             While there could be more active engagement with students, I found that since it was only a 50-minute period, the information provided in a single class was digestible enough that I didn't need student-led examples.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p> <font color="#740A09">Q: Please say more about how non of the teaching elements above need improvement to help your learning.</font>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The class was great. Halley was one of the best math teachers I've had.
        </li>
    </ul>
